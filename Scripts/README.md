# Scripts

### Using these scripts

When using the scripts in this repo, copy the entire script, including the first line with the `#!`, to ensure the code runs with the correct interpreter.

The easiest way to do this is:

1. Navigate to the script you would like to use.
1. Select the **Raw** button.
1. On the page that appears, copy all of the text.
